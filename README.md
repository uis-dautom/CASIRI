## IIoT System for Monitoring the CASIRI Radio Astronomy Station

This repository contains the complete development of the project “IIoT System for Monitoring the Radio Astronomy Station using the MQTT Sparkplug B Protocol”, which integrates a technological solution with an educational strategy aimed at training talent for Industry 4.0.

**Repository Contents:**

Scripts: Python code for data simulation, MQTT publishing, and system validation.  
Validation videos: Step-by-step documented experimental tests.  
Learning guides: Structured educational material covering basic IoT concepts to advanced IIoT implementations.  
Ignition backup: Complete project with functional dashboards for remote visualization of atmospheric variables.  
Technical documentation: Description of system architecture, components, tests, and scalability considerations.  

**Project Objective**  
To design and implement an IIoT system that enables the remote collection, visualization, and storage of data from the CASIRI station using technologies like MQTT Sparkplug B, Ignition 8.1, HiveMQ Cloud, and MySQL, with a pedagogical focus to support hands-on learning in connected industrial systems.
